## Hardware Assembly

The printer arrives in a nicely packaged cardboard box partly pre-assembled and
requires some assembly to be performed.

Follow the official assembly video by creality below till 6:28

:::note[Note]

I have installed a better
[Professional Firmware](https://github.com/mriscoc/Ender3V2S1) so the
instructions after 6:28 in the assembly video don't apply anymore

## Professional Firmware Quick Setup

For a more comprehensive setup guide see:

Now we need to do some software setup. The printer has a knob below LCD Screen
has a knob to control the UI. Turning the knob clockwise will move the UI
Forward and turning it counter-clockwise will move the UI Backwards.

{/* TODO:add link to heading here */}

I am assuming that the printer physical setting have already been done (as
decribed in [Professional Firmware Setup](/guides/professional-firmware-setup))
out of the box for the following steps to work.

:::

### Home the printer

### Tram the bed

### Build a Bed Mesh

## Load Filament

## Print your first model!
