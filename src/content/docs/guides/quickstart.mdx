## Hardware Assembly

The printer arrives in a nicely packaged cardboard box partly pre-assembled and
requires some assembly to be performed.

Follow the official assembly video by creality below till 6:28

:::note[Note]

I have installed a better
[Professional Firmware](https://github.com/mriscoc/Ender3V2S1) so the
instructions after 6:28 in the assembly video don't apply anymore

## Professional Firmware Quick Setup

For a more comprehensive setup guide see:

Now we need to do some software setup. The printer has a click-wheel below the
LCD Screen to control the UI. Turning the knob clockwise will move the UI
Forward and turning it counter-clockwise will move the UI Backwards. The wheel
can pre pressed to register clicks in the UI.

{/* TODO:add link to heading here */}

I am assuming that the printer physical setting have already been done (as
decribed in [Professional Firmware Setup](/guides/professional-firmware-setup))
out of the box for the following steps to work.

:::

### Home the printer

Homing the printer will ensure that the printer knows the coreect position of
the print head. For X and Y axes, the printer uses a limit switch. For the Z
axis, it uses a CR-Touch Probe/Sensor. Follow this video to home the printer.

### Tram the bed

Next, we need to tram the bed. Before tramming remember to clean the bed with a
microfiber cloth. Bed Tramming makes sure that the print bed is parallel to the
printer's X and Y axes. Follow the video below to tram your bed.

:::note[Bed Tramming]

The tramming wizard tells how far the bed's corners are from the Z axis zero
point. Ideally the distance should be 0 but practically we adjust the screws
until we achieve upto 0.04mm variation between max and the min Z distance.

:::

### Build a Bed Mesh

Next we need to build a bed mesh. Even though our corners are trammed, the print
bed is rarely completely flat. So the CR Touch Sensor can probe the bed at 36
different points and build a mesh of the inconsistencies in the print bed's
surface.

Goto `Prepare` > `Auto build Mesh` to start mesh leveling process. This will
heat up the bed to 50&deg;C an then probe 36 points on the bed. You can see the
results on the screen. Press `Continue` to save the mesh. This mesh will be
loaded automatically every time the printer boots.

:::note[The corners are leveled but other points are not]

The corners in the Bed Mesh will be leveled as we already manually levelled them
in the previous step but the other points are not leveled which is okay. The
purpose of building this mesh is so that the while printing the incinsistencies
can be compensated by adjusting the Z height.

## Load Filament

We need to load the filament to start printing!
